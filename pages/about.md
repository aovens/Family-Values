## About the Collection
This collection is an on-going labor of love to digitize the photos, photo negatives, VHS-C's, mini-CD's, and more to a more long-lasting digital format. As the physical degrades, we're able to keep track of these memories and their information, even as folks move and pass on. This particular selection of photos focuses on the Stang-Ovens family, established in 1994, but digs deep into the past of each parental branch as well. 

Originally started as a capstone project for April's MLIS program at UMD, it's a project that's been waiting to get kickstarted. Through this database, it will be shared with other family members so they can cherish the memories here, too.
